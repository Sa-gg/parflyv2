Deadline is tomorrow 5pm 

Hello everyone! We are What, and today, We'll be presenting the user interface and experience design of PARFLY, our web-based courier management system. PARFLY is designed to connect businesses and individuals with drivers for fast and reliable delivery services. Our goal is to simplify the logistics process, making it seamless for users to manage and track their deliveries.

Let’s start by navigating through our key screens. The landing page is structured to provide a smooth and engaging experience. It starts with the **Hero Section**, which immediately captures user attention with a bold statement and a call-to-action (CTA) to encourage sign-ups. This is followed by the **Features Section**, where we highlight the core functionalities of PARFLY, ensuring users understand the benefits of our platform. Next, we have the **About Section**, which provides insight into our mission and what sets PARFLY apart.

To build credibility, we’ve included a **Reviews Section**, showcasing feedback from satisfied users. The **FAQ Section** addresses common questions, helping users find answers quickly. We also have a **Download Section**, allowing users to download our PWA app. This section features a mockup device that showcases how the app looks across different screen devices, reinforcing its accessibility and cross-platform compatibility.. Finally, the **Footer Section** contains important links and contact details, maintaining a consistent and informative structure throughout the page.

Moving on to the login screen, we have a simple, distraction-free login form that maintains visual consistency with our landing page through colors and typography. For the signup screen, we kept the form concise to reduce friction in the registration process. The fields are well-spaced and labeled to guide users efficiently.

Now, let’s discuss our design decisions. Our primary color is #FF6600 (Orange), which conveys energy, urgency, and reliability—qualities essential in the courier industry. The accent color, #772F00 (Deep Orange-Brown), adds warmth and contrast, making key elements stand out. Background colors are a mix of #F2F2F2 (Light Gray) and white, ensuring a clean, uncluttered interface, while text colors include #7A7A7A (Dark Gray) and black for readability and contrast. We use a modern, sans-serif font to maintain readability and professionalism. Bold headings improve scannability, and body text is sized appropriately for comfort. To ensure proper visual hierarchy, important actions like “Sign Up” and “Login” are emphasized with high-contrast buttons, while icons and spacing create a seamless experience, directing users naturally through the interface.

Let’s take a look at our logo. The primary color (#FF6600) represents speed, efficiency, and enthusiasm. The design incorporates elements that suggest motion and reliability, reinforcing the brand’s identity. The simple yet dynamic structure ensures brand recognition across digital and print platforms. Our logo sets the foundation for the entire system’s design, ensuring a consistent and professional look.

How does our design ensure a smooth user experience? We focus on consistency, ensuring that colors, typography, and layout remain uniform across all screens, reinforcing brand identity and usability. A clean, intuitive design minimizes cognitive load, allowing users to quickly understand where to go and what to do. Accessibility is prioritized with sufficient contrast and large touch areas, enhancing usability for all users. Additionally, efficient navigation minimizes unnecessary clicks, allowing users to complete tasks faster.

During the design process, we faced some challenges. Balancing aesthetics with functionality was a key concern, as we wanted a visually appealing interface without compromising usability. We addressed this by conducting usability tests and refining the UI based on feedback. Another challenge was optimizing the signup process to prevent drop-offs, which we tackled by simplifying the form and adding visual cues to guide users smoothly. Finally, ensuring mobile responsiveness was crucial since many users will access PARFLY on mobile devices. We adopted a responsive design approach to ensure all elements scale properly across different screen sizes.

In summary, PARFLY’s design prioritizes clarity, consistency, and ease of use, ensuring a seamless experience from the landing page to login and signup. By maintaining a strong visual identity and a user-centered approach, we create a reliable and intuitive platform. Thank you for watching this presentation! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
